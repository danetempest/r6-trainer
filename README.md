📋 About The Project
This tool was designed for players and coaches who want to move beyond passive learning. Unlike static map tools, the **Tactical Trainer** features an active **"Teacher & Student" engine**.
1.  **Architect Mode:** Upload any map blueprint and design the perfect pro-league setup.
2.  **Exam Mode:** Clear the board and attempt to replicate the setup from memory against a 45-second timer.
3.  **Auto-Grader:** The engine compares your placement against the answer key and highlights missed utility.

✨ Features
* **Universal Map Support:** Works with any map image (JPG/PNG) uploaded from your PC.
* **Pro Utility Sandbox:** Place Reinforcements, Rotation Holes, and Deployable Shields.
* **Ghost Mode:** See "Ghost" outlines of the correct setup if you get stuck.
* **Precision Tools:** Rotate gadgets, delete mistakes, and view exact scoring percentages.
